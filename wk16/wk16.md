## blogs related to SQS in micro service and async process usage.
#### [get start with amazon sqs](https://blog.knoldus.com/getting-started-with-amazon-sqs/)
#### [scale up on sqs](http://blog.blueinfy.com/2018/08/lambda-event-assessment-and-pentesting.html)
#### [sqs limit](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/)
What I learnt from these blogs, sqs itself does not really have hard limit, but if worker is not scaled up correctly to avoid too many messages stuck in queue.

Correct behave is to send metric to cloudwatch and scale up workers and (maybe scale up the DB as well, dyanmo only?? )
