## Tip
In golang

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43335989/golang-os-create-cause-no-such-file-or-directory-error

You can't use ~ or environment variable like $HOME to specify the file path, 
they're string literal and means actual path. 
The error you got is because it treat ~/golang-server.log as a relative path of current directory, 
and there's no directory ~ in current directory.

With manually created sub-directory ~, your code will succeed:
 ~/test/ mkdir \~
 ~/test/ go run t.go
 ~/test/ ls \~
golang-server.log
So need to pass an absolute path or relative path to os.Create.
