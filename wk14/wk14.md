### I reckon with an FCM the architecutre might be somthing like this

My guess if wanna to build it with FCM:

```user_a -> server: authentication
server -> user_a: pass
user_a -> server: create chat to user_b
server -> server: check if possible.
server -> fcm: create a chat group including me.
fcm -> server: okay
server -> user_a: okay
user_a -> fcm: push message
fcm -> user_b: push notification
fcm -> server: push notification
user_b -> fcm: server: reply message
fcm -> user_a: push notification
fcm -> server: push notification```

From the first blog. It seems Facebook managed to create a snapshop to offer history of chat.

From the second blog. Let the notification directly from fcm without go through another server.
