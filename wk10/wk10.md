### shell script double square bracket
http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031 \
if [[  -f $file  ]]; then echo "$file is a regular file"
same as
if [ -f "$file"]; then echo "$file is a regular file"

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22387/how-do-0-and-0-work 
https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe 
https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$0

every process has a few attributes including Pid, PPid, Owner, priority and state. when creating a new process.
Two ways to create a new process. 
1. it will forK() from the process with PPid point to parent and new Pid 
2. overlayed the parent process. Pid will be same as the deceased parent. via exec() function to achieve it.
