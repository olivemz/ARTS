### question
[Q5](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
```cassandraql
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

### solution
```cassandraql

package main

import "fmt"

func longestPalindrome(s string) string {
	i := len(s)
	if i <= 1 {
		return s
	} else {
		finalResult := s[:1]
		for j := 0; j < i-1; j++ {
			blnPass := false
			blnSame := false
			// detect adjacent characters e.g. aa  babbab
			for y := 0; j+1+y <= i-1 && j-y >= 0; y++ {
				blnSame = false
				if s[j+1+y] == s[j-y] {
					blnSame = true
					if 2*y+2 > len(finalResult) {
						finalResult = s[j-y : j+2+y]
					}
				}
				if blnSame == false {
					break
				}
			}
			// detect three some words. e.g. aba acbca
			for x := 1; j-x >= 0 && j+x <= i-1 && j != 0; x++ {
				blnPass = false
				left := s[j-x]
				right := s[j+x]
				if left == right && x >= 1 {
					blnPass = true
					if 2*x+1 > len(finalResult) {
						finalResult = s[j-x : j+x+1]
					}
				}
				if blnPass == false {
					break
				}
			}
		}
		return finalResult
	}
}

func main() {
	x := longestPalindrome("tattarrattat")
	fmt.Println(x)
}

```

##Review
[The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying)
### Logs in distributed systems

While The author analysed the log model could be used to solve two big issues in distribute system.\
`The two problems a log solves—ordering changes and distributing data—are even more important in distributed data systems. `\
How log helps? It is because log is designed to track time of event happened:\
` The answer is that logs have a specific purpose: they record what happened and when. For distributed data systems this is, in many ways, the very heart of the problem.`\
Why WHEN matters?\
`The bit about getting the same input in the same order should ring a bell—that is where the log comes in. This is a very intuitive notion: if you feed two deterministic pieces of code the same input log, they will produce the same output.`\
In another word, 
Author believes via recording and replicate the actions recorded in same order and same way, the result of these operations will be same.
### My question
My question is time matters, the result of an operation will change depending on action happened time, but may depending on how the action `should be defined`. As if it is defined in the way to return same results regardless when it happened, there would be no problem at all.\
Reading arranged in next week shall help me to answer above question.

### Tip
add a backslash(\) at end of lines in md file could cause line break ;)
